Cleaned and standardized a layoffs dataset by removing duplicate records and addressing inconsistencies. Standardized fields such as company names, industries, and dates to ensure uniformity, handled missing values through logical imputation or removal, and optimized the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns. Transformed date formats for time-based analysis and conducted exploratory analysis to identify industries, countries, and time periods most affected by layoffs. Performed trend analysis, created rolling totals, and uncovered company-specific and year-based layoff trends.
